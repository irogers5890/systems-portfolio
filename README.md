# Systems Engineering Portfolio — Ibrahim Rogers

This repository documents selected engineering projects focused on hardware–software integration, system architecture, and test & validation workflows. The emphasis is on defining requirements, measuring performance, and iterating designs based on structured experimental results.

## Featured Projects

### Vision-Guided Pan/Tilt Tracking System
Closed-loop embedded vision system using a Raspberry Pi, camera module, and servo actuation to autonomously track and center a moving target.
