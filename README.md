# Systems Engineering Portfolio — Ibrahim Rogers
**Target Roles:** Systems Engineering, Hardware Test & Validation, Controls, Embedded Systems, and Lab Engineering (Aerospace & Defense)

This repository documents selected engineering projects focused on hardware–software integration, system architecture, and test & validation workflows. The emphasis is on defining requirements, measuring performance, and iterating designs based on structured experimental results.

## Featured Projects

### Vision-Guided Pan/Tilt Tracking System
Closed-loop embedded vision system using a Raspberry Pi, camera module, and servo actuation to autonomously track and center a moving target.  
→ [View Project](GIMBAL.md)

### Radiation Shielding Composite Test System (Melagen Labs)
Experimental test system designed to evaluate radiation attenuation performance of a melanin–HDPE composite using Cs-137 sources and statistical validation in Python.  
→ [View Project](MELAGEN.md)

## Focus Areas
- Systems Architecture & Integration  
- Requirements Definition & Verification  
- Experimental Test Design  
- Hardware–Software Debugging  
- Engineering Documentation

## Engineering Philosophy
I design systems by defining measurable requirements, building test infrastructure early, and iterating based on quantified performance and failure modes. My focus is on creating hardware–software systems that remain stable, debuggable, and verifiable under real-world constraints.
